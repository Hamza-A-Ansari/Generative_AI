# RAG with Multi Data Source

This repository provides an implementation of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that integrates multiple data sources to enhance the accuracy and contextual relevance of generated text. The implementation uses the Langchain framework to build a retriever capable of querying various data sources and a generation chain that synthesizes the final output.

## What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a technique that combines the strengths of information retrieval and text generation models. By fetching relevant information from external knowledge sources in real-time, RAG models can produce responses that are more accurate, contextually relevant, and informative compared to models that rely solely on pre-trained internal knowledge.

## Pipeline Overview

The RAG system implemented here follows these steps:

1. **Data Source Integration**:
   - The system connects to multiple data sources, such as Wikipedia, arXiv, or other APIs. These sources provide diverse information that the retriever can query based on the input query.

2. **Retriever Configuration**:
   - A retriever is set up to query the connected data sources. The retriever processes the input query, searches across the multiple data sources, and returns the most relevant documents or information snippets.

3. **Chain Construction**:
   - The retrieved information from multiple sources is processed through a chain. This step may involve ranking, filtering, and integrating data from different sources to provide a comprehensive context for the text generation model.

4. **Text Generation**:
   - The processed information is fed into a text generation model, such as a transformer-based language model. The generation model uses the enriched context to produce a well-informed and contextually accurate output.

5. **Output**:
   - The generated text, augmented with information from multiple data sources, is returned as the final output.

## Techniques Used

- **Langchain**: A powerful framework for connecting and utilizing language models with external tools and data sources. In this notebook, Langchain is used to manage the retrieval and generation pipeline effectively.
- **Multiple Data Sources**: The system is capable of querying multiple data sources like Wikipedia and arXiv to enrich the context for the generation model.
- **Dense/Sparse Retrieval**: Techniques for retrieving relevant information from diverse and possibly large-scale data sources.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies 
3. Open the `agents.ipynb` notebook.
4. Configure the data sources as per your requirements.
5. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the RAG pipeline and generate outputs using multiple data sources.

## Conclusion

This implementation showcases the potential of using multiple data sources in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. By querying various sources, the system can provide more comprehensive and contextually aware responses, making it suitable for a wide range of applications where diverse knowledge is required.
