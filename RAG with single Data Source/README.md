# RAG with Single Data Source

This repository contains an implementation of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using a single data source. The implementation leverages the Langchain framework to build a retriever and a generation chain, providing an efficient way to handle large-scale language tasks by incorporating external knowledge from a database.

## What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a hybrid model that combines information retrieval and text generation techniques. Instead of relying solely on a pre-trained model's internal knowledge, RAG enhances the model's ability by fetching relevant information from an external knowledge base or data source in real-time, which is then used to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## Pipeline Overview

The RAG system implemented in this repository follows these steps:

1. **Data Source Setup**:
   - The first step involves setting up the data source from which the retriever will fetch the information. This could be a corpus of documents, a database, or any structured/unstructured data that the retriever can query.

2. **Retriever Configuration**:
   - A retriever is configured to search the data source. The retriever is responsible for finding and returning the most relevant pieces of information from the data source based on a given query. Various techniques like sparse or dense retrieval can be used.

3. **Chain Construction**:
   - The retrieved information is passed through a chain, typically a series of operations or transformations that refine the input before it's fed into the generator. This can include filtering, ranking, and context integration.

4. **Text Generation**:
   - Finally, the processed data is fed into a text generation model (e.g., GPT-based models), which synthesizes the final response. This generation model benefits from the external knowledge fetched by the retriever, resulting in more informed and accurate outputs.

5. **Output**:
   - The generated text is the final output, enriched with the retrieved context, making it more accurate and contextually relevant.

## Techniques Used

- **Langchain**: A framework for building applications that utilize language models. In this notebook, Langchain is used to connect the retriever and the text generation model seamlessly.
- **Transformer Models**: The generation part is likely based on transformer models, known for their superior performance in natural language processing tasks.
- **Dense/Sparse Retrieval**: The retriever component might utilize dense or sparse retrieval techniques to fetch relevant information from the data source.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies 
3. Open the `retriever.ipynb` notebook.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to configure your data source and run the RAG pipeline.

## Conclusion

This implementation demonstrates the power of combining retrieval and generation in a single pipeline. By augmenting the generative model with external information, the RAG system produces outputs that are more accurate, informative, and contextually aware.
