# LangGraph: A Framework for Multimodal Conversational Agents

LangGraph is a powerful framework designed for building and managing conversational AI agents equipped with tool usage capabilities. This framework integrates advanced natural language processing (NLP) and tools-based reasoning to enable agents to perform tasks such as interacting with external APIs, database queries, and generating meaningful dialogues.

## Overview

LangGraph leverages large language models (LLMs) and integrates them with external tools for extending their reasoning and execution capabilities. By doing so, LangGraph provides a structured approach to build conversational agents that are:

1. **Interactive**: Facilitates smooth human-like conversations.
2. **Tool-Enabled**: Agents can perform specific tasks beyond simple text generation.
3. **Modular**: Enables flexibility and reusability for multiple use cases.
